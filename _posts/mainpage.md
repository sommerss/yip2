ur cool n awesome!! take a shower if ur home, i know you THINK its a lot of work but the BENEFITS you know youll feel better 

if ur NOT taking a shower one assignment in math isnt that important, you wont forget everything, youll do great on the tests you always do

if its ANOTHER subject then just do a little at a time its ok if its late dont worry about it too much and its always ok to ask for an extension i promise the teachers wont be annoyed you CAN ask but i know u wont ur so silly

GO do something you like like watch strangeaeons or use pinty or something or perhaps even download the jelly simulator app
