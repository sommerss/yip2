## PROOF OF ATTENDANCE

here is proof that i was at N@TM with a picture of me and Bria in the compsci room after my presentation to mr yeung

## 3D animation

here is the first class i went to, which is 3D animation. I really liked the way they made the displays for this class and I feel like this specific area really showcased the individualism of the students because they got to choose what to create. However, the other area may have even been a better glimpse into the minds of the students because it showed their different takes on the same prompts. We do basically this same thing in compsci when we are given a prompt and we can create basically anything we want, so I feel like this was a more visual display of how the two classes are similar. 

## CERAMICS

After 3d animation I went to ceramics, which is a class I have taken before, but I was really surprised because everything in the classroom was so much more complex than I was expecting. There was this awesome octopus that I know would have taken hours upon hours of work to make and I was just shocked at how much effort the students put in. You could really tell that they were passionate about what they were working on despite how different the projects were, which is also similar to compsci. 

# PHOTOGRAPHY

I went to photography, which is a class one of my friends is in. I really liked how the photos were all extremely high quality but still captured the individualism of the students. My friend had taken a photo of one of the basketball games, so it was fun to look around and try to find that among all the hung up pictures.


## DESIGN MIXED MEDIA

I considered taking this class at the beginning of the year, so it was interesting to see the kind of things they were working on. I liked how this specific set of posters had this kind of connection but was also very different. There was also a section for social justice art, which I thought was really cool and thoughtful and sensitive. 


FINAL REFLECTION:
I think this night gave me more perspective on how lots of wildly different classes can have similar aspects and can allow students to put time and effort into things they are passionate about and be able to showcase and be proud of them. Overall, I really enjoyed this n@tm and was really impressed by the amount of work people put into it.
